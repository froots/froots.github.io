    <p>These days I write <a href="/articles/">articles</a> and <a href="/automated-responsive-design-testing/">books</a>, train and mentor teams, develop technical strategy and build web applications for my clients.</p>

<h2>Are you building the web app to match your product vision?</h2>

<ul class="list list--spaced list--bullets">
  <li><strong>The modern web provides a galaxy of capabilities, tools and frameworks</strong>.<br> Which technical approach will make your users awesome <em>and</em> let your team iterate quickly?</li>
  <li><strong>Growing a web application to succeed for the long term is hard</strong>.<br> You have to move quickly to solve user problems. But you don't want to create an unmaintainable mess. The web platform provides a lot of great opportunities, but it's tempting to over-engineer simple problems. What approach provides the best balance?</li>
  <li><strong>Is your team struggling to make changes to your product?</strong><br> Early on, it's easy to build valuable features quickly. But UI code can become a headache that slows the whole team down. Do you start again or make gradual improvements?</li>
  <li><strong>Modern front-end applications can be more complex to build and maintain than your back-end</strong>.<br> But it's hard to find front-end engineers with a solid software engineering background. Should you train up your existing team or hire specialists?</li>
  <li><strong>You're starting out on a new web application project, but can't agree the best approach</strong>.<br> How do you get past differing opinions and build the right thing?</li>
</ul>

I've been there and done all that. <strong>I can help your company tackle these challenges</strong>.

<h2>I help web product teams build and maintain great front-end applications</h2>

<p><strong>Building a good web application isn't just about slick visuals and the latest JavaScript framework</strong>.</p>

<p>It's built for usability, accessibility, long-term learning, continuous improvement, and ease of support and maintenance.</p>

<p>I've got buckets of experience working with leaders, product managers, designers, engineers, marketing professionals and support staff to develop a technical web strategy that balances these aims.</p>

<p>Unlike big consulting companies and agencies, <strong>I focus on helping your team learn what works for you</strong>, not on short-term quick fixes that make me look good.</p>

<p>I work out of the beautiful city of Edinburgh, and focus mostly on web product companies and teams based in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Get in touch now</strong> and tell me a little bit about your current situation. I'll get back in touch as quickly as I can.</p>
