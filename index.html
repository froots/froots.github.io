    <p>After becoming a public company in 2016, FreeAgent had ambitious growth and expansion plans for their accounting SaaS product. To grow the team efficiently, they needed a shared approach for developing web applications across multiple product teams.</p>
    <p>I worked with the management team, software engineers, product managers and designers to develop a comprehensive front-end development approach, which is now being rolled out across the organisation.</p>
