    <h2 class="mt0">FreeAgent needed a shared vision for web app development</h2>
    <p>After becoming a public company in 2016, FreeAgent had ambitious growth and expansion plans for their cloud accounting SaaS product. To grow the team efficiently, they needed a shared approach for developing web applications across multiple product teams.</p>
    <p>I worked with the management team, software engineers, product managers and designers to develop a comprehensive front-end development approach. I then coached a team to deliver the first major project using that approach. FreeAgent are now rolling out this approach across their product teams.</p>
