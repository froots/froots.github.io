      <li>You are committed to <strong>high quality</strong> web designs that work across all the major browsers</li>

      <li>You wish there was a <strong>better way to test</strong> that your designs work on popular devices and browsers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How often have you manually tested your design only to find that your approach simply doesn't work on one of the major browsers?</p>
    <p>Sometimes this means having to change tack completely, or putting browser-specific hacks in place to work around the problem. <strong>Stupid browsers</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Automate!</h2>
    <p>With some upfront time investment, automating your design testing can <strong>pay off handsomely</strong> over the course of a project.</p>
    <p>There are now tools that can test your designs in a wide range of browsers and devices for you, to the specifications that you set.</p>
    <p>Automated testing tools can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be set up to run on demand, or automatically when code changes</li>
      <li>test responsive designs, so that you can set different expectations at different screen dimensions</li>
      <li>run all these tests in the cloud so you don't need to provide infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>By automating such a big chunk of work, you may see some of these benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save many, many hours over the course of project</li>
      <li>Colleagues, clients or managers will think you are some kind of wizard</li>
      <li>You and your team will be more motivated to fix bugs</li>
      <li>Your design process can change for the betterj, by embracing testing earlier</li>
      <li>Take an incremental approach to quality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This visual step-by-step guide will <strong>help you to set up an automated testing system</strong>, write your own test specs for your own designs, and get started changing how you work for the better.</p>
