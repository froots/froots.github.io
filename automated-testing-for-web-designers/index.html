  <p class="intro-text">Testing your websites across all the popular browsers and devices is <strong>tedious</strong>, <strong>slow</strong> and often <strong>expensive</strong>. There are 100 more useful things that you could be doing, if testing weren't so important.</p>

<div class="container">
  <p>You're committed to providing high quality web designs that work across all the major browsers. You also use the latest reponsive design techniques to provide a great experience for users of different devices. How often have you tested all the browsers only to find that your approach simply doesn't work on one of the major browsers? Sometimes this means having to change tack completely, or putting browser-specific hacks in place to work around the problem. Stupid browsers.</p>

  <p>Backing up your commitment to high quality by manually testing on a wide range of devices and browsers takes an awful lot of time, expense and anguish.</p>

  <p>For one thing, you've got to set up different browsers on different operating systems. This requires using virtual machines if you do it yourself. For mobile device testing, you need to work out how to run the right simulators, or buy real devices to test on. Then you've got to keep all those VMs, simulators and devices in working order and charged, ready to be used. More overhead.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't it be great to delegate away most of this tedium and overhead so you can focus on those 100 other more important things?</p>

  <p>Browser testing can be very repetitive, which is often why it is tedious to do. But a repetitive task is often a task that can be delegated to a computer and automated. With some upfront time investment, automating your design testing can pay off handsomely over the course of a project.</p>

  <p>There are now tools that will check your designs in a wide range of browsers and devices for you, to the exact specifications that you set. These tools can be set up to run on demand, or whenever a team member commits new code to your repository. Some even support responsive design differences, so that you can set different expectations at different screen dimensions. You can even run all these checks in the cloud so that you don't need to maintain a bunch of virtual machines and a full test device collection.</p>

  <p>By automating such a big chunk of work, your colleagues, clients and bosses will think you are some kind of wizard. You and your team will likely get more motivated to fix bugs. Your design process might even change for the better, by embracing testing much earlier and focusing on quality all the way through.</p>

  <p>This visual step-by-step guide will help you to set up an automated testing system, write your own test specs for your own designs, and get started changing how you work for the better.</p>
