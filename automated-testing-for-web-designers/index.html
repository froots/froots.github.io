    <p>How often have you manually tested your design only to find that your approach simply doesn't work on one of the major browsers?</p>
    <p>Sometimes this means having to change tack completely, or putting browser-specific hacks in place to work around the problem. <strong>Stupid browsers</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Automate!</h2>
    <p>With some upfront time investment, automating your design testing can <strong>pay off handsomely</strong> over the course of a project.</p>
    <p>There are now tools that can test your designs in a wide range of browsers and devices for you, to the specifications that you set.</p>
    <p>Automated testing tools can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be set up to run <strong>on demand</strong>, or <strong>automatically</strong> when code changes</li>
      <li><strong>test responsive designs</strong>, so that you can set different expectations at different screen dimensions</li>
      <li>run all these tests <strong>in the cloud</strong> so you don't need to provide infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
