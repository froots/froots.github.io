## Are you building the web app to match your product vision?

__The modern web provides a galaxy of capabilities, tools and frameworks__. Which technical approach will make your users awesome _and_ let your team iterate quickly?

__Growing a web application to succeed for the long term is hard__. You have to move quickly to solve user problems. But you don't want to create an unmaintainable mess. The web platform provides a lot of great opportunities, but it's tempting to over-engineer simple problems. What approach provides the best balance?

__Is your team struggling to make changes to your product?__. Early on, it was easy to build valuable features quickly. But now your UI code is a headache that slows the whole team down. Do you start again or make gradual improvements?

__Modern front-end applications can be more complex to build and maintain than your back-end__. But it's hard to find front-end engineers with a solid software engineering background. Should you train up your existing team or hire specialists?

__You're starting out on a new web application project, but can't agree the best approach__. How do you get past differing opinions and build the right thing?

I've been there and done all that. __I can help your company tackle these challenges__.

## I help web product teams build and maintain great front-end applications

__Building a good web application isn't just about slick visuals and the latest JavaScript framework__.

It's built for usability, accessibility, long-term learning, continuous improvement, and ease of support and maintenance.

I've got buckets of experience working with leaders, product managers, designers, engineers, marketing professionals and support staff to develop a technical web strategy that balances these aims.

Unlike big consulting companies and agencies, __I focus on helping your team learn what works for you__, not on short-term quick fixes that make me look good.

I work out of the beautiful city of __Edinburgh__, and focus mostly on web product companies and teams based in the UK.

__Get in touch now__ and tell me a little bit about your current situation. I'll get back in touch as quickly as I can.
