I'm trying to figure out something, so today I've got a question for you if you are a front-end engineering leader in any capacity. Your job title could be _Grand Poobah of teh Front Endz_, or you could be that one software developer who everyone turns to for guidance on UI matters, without any formal recognition.

Here's the question:

__Do you ever talk / socialise / discuss / engage with other front-end leaders, either in real life or online? If so, where does this happen?__

I'd love as many replies to this as possible, so __please reply__ even if you _never_ talk to other front-end leaders.

For my part, I:

* Go to meetups in Edinburghm (where I live) and occasionally meet front end leaders there
* Have a very small number of Edinburgh-based friends and ~~enemies~~ acquaintances who match this description. We meet in pubs, at meetups, local tech community events, etc.
* Sometimes chat in the curtailed medium that is Twitter
* Occasionally drop in to a couple of Slack channels either dedicated to front end development or to tech leadership (e.g. the Rands Slack community)
* Go to a handful of conferences a year, again either dedicated to front-end tech or to tech leadership

How about you?

All the best,

-- Jim
