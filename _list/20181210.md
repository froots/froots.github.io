I have a quick informal survey for you today. __Please reply to this email__ with short answers to these questions.

1. _How many people in your organisation contribute some kind of front-end development work?_
2. _Do you hold any regular cross-team meetings for discussing front-end development approaches, code standards and architecture?_
3. _If so, how often are these meetings held?_
4. _Who attends these meetings?_ (e.g. designers, developers, UX researchers)
5. _What decision-making power does this group hold?_
6. _What are these meetings / this group called?_

Thanks!
