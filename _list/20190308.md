A [couple of weeks back]({% link _list/20190222.md %}), we took a look at how estimating the _cost of delay_ of each proposed feature or change to a product can be used to assess different kinds of changes on equal terms.

Of course, the example I gave was extremely simple. Comparing three small feature additions can be relatively straightforward. In practice, for many types of change, it's often extremely difficult to arrive at a reasonably accurate estimate of its true value.

If you're working on a SaaS product, you may be lucky enough to be working on a 'growth' team, responsible for making improvements to the user acquisition funnel. Changes here are often associated directly with changes in conversion rates. Like this example of adding a picture of a puppy beside the primary call to action: [example].

This is why acquisition funnels are the poster child for experimental approaches to product development. It's easy to make direct links between actions and outcomes.

Similarly, certain technical changes can be directly linked to a reduction in costs. For example, if you swap out your existing third party email service for another cheaper but otherwise equivalent alternative, you should be able to estimate the cost savings by volume extremely accurately.

But most of the scope of product development (not to mention overall service delivery) is so much broader and more nebulous than these edge cases.

Unfortunately, it's the important but not necessarily urgent changes that often prove to be the hardest to estimate in terms of value. If you've ever tried to make a case for removing under-used features, making design improvements, paying down tech debt, rewriting inefficient code or improving performance, you know what I mean.

We're often met with responses like "I agree we need to do that but it's not the most important thing right now as we've got to keep [big customer or partner] on board by building [thing they want]."

And then when that's done, we may try again, only to be knocked back again by some other priority one must-have.

The true problems here are feature-factory culture, sales-driven development and assuming that inputs and outputs are linear. In these contexts (which are still the norm), it can be hard to make the case for a longer-term viewpoint. My early efforts here most often met with failure because I was trying to appeal to long-term benefits. Using terms like 'cost of delay' sound so much more immediate!

Let's take another look at our feature examples from the last email, but this time we have another option: paying down some tech debt. Let's assume that the tech debt improvement work is not major, but is in the part of the system that we're planning on adding lots more features to. The team has estimated that the tech debt work will take 3 weeks to complete, but make it 20% quicker to deliver subsequent features.

Let's see what impact doing this work will have on the overall cost of delay.

Remember:

* value is in Guatemalan Quetzals (Q)
* CD3 = Cost of delay / duration / 1000

Here's the cost of delay, ordering features by CD3, which we discovered was the most efficient approach:

| Feature | Dev time | Value to business | CD3 | Cost |
|---------|----------|------------------:|----:|-----:|
|A|2 weeks|Q5,000|2.5|2 * Q5k = Q10k|
|C|1 week|Q2,000|2|(1 + 2) * Q2k = Q6k|
|B|6 weeks|Q10,000|1.7|(6 + 1 + 2) * Q10k = Q90k|
|Total|9 weeks|Q19,000|-|__Q106,000__|

And here's the same calculation with the tech debt work performed before moving on to features:

| Feature | Dev time | Adj dev time | Value to business | CD3 | Cost |
|---------|----------|------------------:|----:|-----:|
|(TD)|3 wk|3 wk|Q0|0|0|0|
|A|2 wk|1.6 wk|Q5,000|2.5|(3 + 1.6) * Q5k = Q23k|
|C|1 wk|0.8 wk|Q2,000|2|(3 + 1.6 + 0.8) * Q2k = Q10.8k|
|B|6 wk|4.8 wk|Q10,000|1.7|(3 + 1.6 + 0.8 + 4.8) * Q10k = Q102k|
|Total|12 wk|10.2 wk|Q19,000|-|__Q135,800__|

Oh dear! Our overall cost of delay is 28% higher if we do the tech debt work first!

In this case, if we could be sure that these are the only three features we are going to add in that part of the product, we probably shouldn't bother with the tech debt improvements if the only benefit of them is to make development work ,more efficient.

But if you're planning a whole programme of work lasting more than 9 weeks, with extensive business value, the picture starts to change. Let's add a complicated, high-value feature to the mix.

First, without doing the tech debt work:

| Feature | Dev time | Value to business | CD3 | Cost |
|---------|----------|------------------:|----:|-----:|
|D|16 weeks|Q48,000|3|16 * Q48k = Q768,000k|
|A|2 weeks|Q5,000|2.5|(16 + 2) * Q5k = Q90k|
|C|1 week|Q2,000|2|(16 + 1 + 2) * Q2k = Q38k|
|B|6 weeks|Q10,000|1.7|(16 + 6 + 1 + 2) * Q10k = Q250k|
|Total|26 weeks|Q65,000|-|__Q1,146,000__|

Even doing the new feature first (because it has the highest CD3 value), we can see the massive impact it has on overall cost of delay!

And now with the tech debt work up front:

| Feature | Dev time | Adj time | Value to business | CD3 | Cost |
|---------|----------|------------------:|----:|-----:|
|(TD)|3 wk|3 wk|Q0|0|0|0|
|D|16 wk|12.8 wk|Q48,000|3|(3 + 12.8) * Q48k = Q758.4k|
|A|2 wk|1.6 wk|Q5,000|2.5|(3 + 12.8 + 1.6) * Q5k = Q87k|
|C|1 wk|0.8 wk|Q2,000|2|(3 + 12.8 + 1.6) * Q2k = Q50.6k|
|B|6 wk|4.8 wk|Q10,000|1.7|(3 + 12.8 + 1.6 + 4.8) * Q10k = Q222k|
|Total|28 wk|23 wk|Q65,000|-|__Q1,118,000__|

That's a pretty marginal difference, but it's now more efficient to do the tech debt work.

Looking at this, it should not be hard to see how even a 20% improvement can pay dividends if we were planning an extensive programme of work on this part of the product. But how quickly it does so is down to the value of the subsequent work to the business and not just how long it takes developers to create features.

This approach is just limited to tech debt. Any other work that might impact the team's future ability to drive through value can be assessed in the same way.

The figures I've presented here are hypothetical. In reality, you're looking for unequivocal evidence one way or the other. If your estimates produce a marginal difference like the example above, you should probably make decisions based on more pragmatic concerns.

Next time we'll look at some examples of these pragmatic concerns.

All the best,
