title: Front-end channel on Rands Slack

I enjoy hanging out in the very popular Rands tech leadership Slack community. There are now over 7500 members, and channels for almost every topic that tech leaders can think up, including `#hotsauce`, `#whiskey` and `#3d-printing`.

Despite all these niche channels, I was surprised to discover that there was no channel dedicated to front-end.

Until now. I created one.

So if you want to chat about all things front-end and leadership, come and join the discussion!
