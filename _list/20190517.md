I have a question for you this week*. Here it is:

__Apart from front-end development, what other aspects of technology and the web are you deeply interested in? Why?__

OK, strictly speaking that's _two_ questions. Let's call it a two-part question and be done with it.

I'd love to know what other topics front-end developers spend their time thinking about, so please hit reply and let me know.

All the best,

-- Jim
