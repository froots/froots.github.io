I've just been experimenting with [Webhint](https://webhint.io), which looks to be a very promising project for linting accessibility, performance, security, interoperability and other issues.

I now have a single NPM command for my site that tells me that I have a total of 86 errors to look at! ðŸ˜²

The project has been undergoing a lot of change. It emerged from the Microsoft Edge team, but the project has now been renamed from Sonarwhal and donated to the JS Foundation so that it can be developed using a community governance model. This can only be a positive step.

You can get a feel for what it offers by trying it on your own site from the [scanner page](https://webhint.io/scanner/), but it can also be integrated into your continuous integration pipeline and configured to run only the hints you need.

All the best,
