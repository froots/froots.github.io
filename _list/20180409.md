As I'm just starting out with these messages about front-end development leadership, please bear with me this week as I conduct a little bit of audience research.

I would flipping love it if you could just reply to this email and tell me:

__What is your motivation for being or becoming a lead front-end developer?__

I'm listening... :-)
