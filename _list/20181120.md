There's an oft-cited article about [optimising your code for deletion]().

It's one of my favourite assertions about web app development, because it goes against much of the commonly accepted advice. Don't worry too much about duplication. Optimise for easy localised deletion and rewriting instead.

[Yesterday]({% link _list/20181119.md %}), I mentioned how our practices can change and need to change depending on the circumstances and purpose of the work. Previously, I've also written about the [benefits of little rewrites]() over endless optimisation and refactoring.

Much of what we've 'learned' about software development practices still feels like it came from pre-web days, when software was shipped relatively rarely. Correctness was a big deal when you had little or no subsequent access to modify code.

And then there are horrors like this Hacker News (_spit_) comment about working on Oracle DB.

The web's delivery model allows us to consider new ways of working that don't concern themselves so much with correctness, but are more about the safety of localised change.

What's more, the rise of hypothesis-driven product development and lean methods further encourages us down this route by taking advantage of short cycle times to optimise for rapid learning.

If we're to work in this way, premature abstraction is a giant waste. We might easily spend weeks creating a neat abstraction, only for it to become irrelevant during user research and later product iterations.

I sometimes feel like this about big kitchen-sink frameworks and libraries. They can feel like a giant collection of premature abstractions dropped into your project all in one go.

All the best,
