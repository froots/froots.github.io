[Drew (The Voice) Neil](http://drewneil.com/) and myself were invited to talk about our contrasting views on progressive enhancement at [Refresh Edinburgh](http://refreshedinburgh.org/) this week.

It was my privilege to defend progressive enhancement's honour with a talk about why it is still a relevant approach, and how it fits in to the current reality of device variety, fragmented support, and constant innovation. You can [watch the video](https://vimeo.com/38016394), [see the slides on Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/froots/p/futuristic-progressive-enhancement) or grab a [PDF of the slides with notes](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6983841/futuristic-progressive-enhancement.pdf) (22.8Mb download).
