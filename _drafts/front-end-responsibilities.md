I put together a long list of front end responsiblities in a GitHub repository.

I am hoping that these will be useful for:

* discussing and formulating job roles
* as a starting point for consulting engagements
* for those considering a career in front end development
* to share knowledge about the scope front-end engineering roles

The intention is not to outline the responsibilities that *all* front-end engineers should have, but to provide an exhaustive list of activities, responsibilities and remit that is or could be covered by 'front-end engineering'. It's the difference between 'What does a front-end engineer do?' and 'What could a front-end engineer do in theory?'

For example, this list could be useful to think about in the context of your current role. Go through the list and consider how much time or energy you put into each activity, then think about where you'd like to be. You can use the difference for professional development planning, or to think more concretely about what you'd like to get out of your next job.

From a personal point of view, I started this simply because I can easily neglect some responsibilities if they are not written down somewhere.
