I've never had this type of coaching before, so I was worried about whether it would be useful. It was definitely worth it. Instead of just giving a concrete one-time solution to an issue, Jim provides a framework for thinking about the issue and finding a solution. This is much more valuable for addressing related issues in the future. It's important for everybody to have someone to bounce ideas off and help you put things in perspective, especially if it's someone who has been in the same situation as you.
