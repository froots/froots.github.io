## Hire Jim

__Hi. I'm, Jim__. I was previously Director of Engineering at [FanDuel](https://www.fanduel.com/) and have over 20 years experience developing web applications and websites for companies like [Sky](https://www.sky.com/), [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/) and [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/).

I help growing web product companies with their front-end applications.

Here are some things I can help with:

* Technical product strategy for front-end applications
* Front-end architecture and technology choice
* Team development and hiring advice
* Lean JavaScript web application development
* Legacy JavaScript and CSS code transformation

## Realise your product vision

Can your team build the web app to match your product vision?

__The modern web provides a galaxy of capabilities, tools and frameworks__. Which technical approach will make your users awesome _and_ be easy to maintain?

__Growing a product over the long term is hard__. Maybe your team struggles with your existing user interface code. Do you start again or make gradual improvements?

You want to be able to __launch innovative features__. But you also want to __cater to all your users__, irrespective of the device they are using.

__Front-end applications can be more complex to build and maintain than your back-end__. But it's hard to find front-end engineers with a solid software engineering background.

__You're starting out on a new project, but can't agree the best approach__. How do you get past opinions and build the right thing?

__I can help your company tackle these challenges__.

## I help web product teams build and maintain great front-end applications

__Building a good web application isn't just about slick visuals and the latest JavaScript framework__.

It's built for usability, accessibility, long-term learning, continuous improvement, and ease of support and maintenance.

I've got buckets of experience working with leaders, product managers, designers, engineers, marketing professionals and support staff to develop a technical web strategy that balances these aims.

Unlike big consulting companies and agencies, __I focus on helping your team learn what works for you__, not on short-term quick fixes that make me look good.

I work out of the beautiful city of __Edinburgh__, and focus mostly on web product companies and teams based in the UK.

__Get in touch now__ and tell me a little bit about your current situation. I'll get back in touch as quickly as I can.
