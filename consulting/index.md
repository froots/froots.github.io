## You're busy, so...

...here are some things I can help with:

* Technical product strategy for front-end applications
* Front-end architecture and technology choice
* Team development and hiring advice
* Automation tooling for front-end testing, continuous integration and continuous delivery
* Lean JavaScript web application development
* Legacy JavaScript and CSS code transformation

## Fulfil your product vision

__Can your team create the web app your product vision expects?__

Many frustrating barriers can get in the way, even though the team is doing their best.

### For example:

Perhaps you're __fighting against the front-end code you already have__. Should you start from scratch or make iterative improvements? How will this affect your ability to deliver value to your users and attract new customers?

Maybe you're unsure about which technical approach will deliver value to users _and_ be easy to maintain.

__The modern web provides a bewildering array of capabilities, tools and frameworks__. Which ones are best for your product and team?

You want to be able to __launch innovative features__ that your competitors struggle to copy.

But you also want to __cater to all your users__, irrespective of their abilities or the device they are using.

Are these mutually exclusive aims?

I can help you to tackle these challenges incrementally using a __lean experimental learning approach__.

## Empower your team to execute your strategy

__High-quality front-end applications are now as complex to build and maintain as back-end systems.__

But experienced HTML, CSS and JavaScript engineers are hard to come by.

To deal with the complexity of modern web user interfaces, product teams are adopting recognised software engineering practices like test-driven development, automation, continuous integration and continuous deployment.

__Does your team have the skills and tools it needs to build and maintain your product?__ Should you develop your current team's skills or hire specialists?

## Been there, done that

__I can help__. Here's some relevant experience:

* __20 years of web development experience__ with startups, agencies, government departments and large enterprises.
* Director of Engineering at FanDuel, one of Scotland's two celebrated 'unicorns'.
* Helped grow FanDuel from 20 to 400 employees and a valuation of over USD$1 billion.
* Shaped cross-platform and technical web strategy for products with well over a million users.
* Transformed the product into a slick multi-channel entertainment experience.
* Hired, grew and led teams of front-end specialists.

__I'm familiar with the challenges experienced by both plucky new startups and unicorns alike__. I can help your company as you tread this path.

## I help web product teams build and maintain great client applications

__Building a good web application isn't just about slick visuals and the latest JavaScript framework__.

It's built for usability, accessibility, long-term learning, continuous improvement, and ease of support and maintenance.

I've got buckets of experience working with leaders, product managers, designers, engineers, marketing professionals and support staff to develop a technical web strategy that balances these aims.

Unlike big consulting companies and agencies, __I focus on helping your team learn what works for you__, not on short-term quick fixes that make me look good.

I work out of the beautiful city of __Edinburgh__, and focus mostly on web product companies and teams based in the UK.

__Get in touch now__ and tell me a little bit about your current situation. I'll get back in touch as quickly as I can.

## What people say about me...

> Jim was instrumental in building FanDuel into the cross-platform product it is today. He single-handedly built our first mobile website, and brought product and UX insight as well as technical implementation. Later, he architected and led the creation of our API, which now underpins our product ecosystem. Beyond his technical contribution he built an excellent team and helped the organization with its agile development approach. Inspiring, highly capable, and a positive problem solver, James was a pleasure to work with.

Tom Griffiths, _Chief Product Officer and Co-Founder, FanDuel_

> Jim was instrumental in the growth and technical direction in FanDuel. His responsibilities covered technical direction for front end, recruitment and development of the team and architectural improvements whilst balancing with business needs and direction. Jim is very well thought of, very easy to work with and his opinion was always sought. Pleasure to work with him, he would be an asset wherever he goes.

Eileen McLaren, _VP Engineering, FanDuel_

> Jim is an exceptional front end developer that helped establish, architect and implement a lot of the foundational products we now use. He is a great all rounder with a persona that is calm, authoritative and humble. He has helped me greatly in implementing front-end test-driven development and is not only respected but liked and known at all levels of the organisation.
