# Jim Newbery - Front-end strategy for growing web products

## Fulfil your product vision

Create a great, sustainable web product, by using the power of the modern web, and incrementally designing a technical product strategy informed by learning.

Is your team able to build and maintain that great web application your product vision demands? All sorts of frustrating barriers can get in the way, even though the team is doing their best.

Perhaps your team struggles to create real value for users because they're fighting against the front-end code you already have. Should you start from scratch or try to improve it gradually? How will this affect your ability to deliver value to your users and attract new customers?

Maybe you're uncertain about what technical approach will deliver short-term value to users _and_ be easy to maintain in the long run. The modern web provides a bewildering array of capabilities, tools and frameworks. Which ones are best for your product and team?

You'd like to cater for all your users, irrespective of their abilities or the device they are using. And you want to be able to launch innovative features that your competitors struggle to copy. Are these mutually exclusive?

In my experience, the most successful way around these challenges is to tackle them incrementally by using experimentation and learning techniques.

## Enable your team to execute your strategy

High-quality front-end applications are now just as complex to build and maintain as back-end systems. But experienced HTML, CSS and JavaScript engineers are hard to come by, and the array of tools are techniques are bewildering and constantly changing.

To deal with the complexity of modern web user interfaces, front-end engineers are adopting seasoned software engineering practices like test and build automation, continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Does your team have the skills and tools they need to build and maintain your product? Should you develop your current team or hire specialists?

## Been there, done that

I can help. I was Lead Front-End Engineer and then a Director of Engineering at FanDuel for four years as the company grew from a plucky startup of 20 employees to one of Scotland's two celebrated 'unicorns', with 400 employees and a valuation of over USD$1 billion.

In my time at FanDuel, I shaped the cross-platform and technical web strategy for a fantasy sports product that now boasts well over one million players. I hired a team of front-end specialists that transformed the product into a slick multi-channel entertainment experience. All this was done in an rapidly changing competitive and commercial environment for a company that was carving out a new industry.

I have the benefit of 20 years of development experience working in product teams for startups, agencies, government departments and big companies like Sky and Channel 4. I've helped to develop web applications and web sites used by millions of people.

I'm familiar with the challenges and needs of plucky new startups and unicorns alike. Maybe I can help your company as you tread this path.

## I help web product teams build and maintain great client applications

Building a good web application isn't just about slick visuals and the latest JavaScript framework. It's an embodiment of product vision to make your users better at what they do. It's built for usability, accessibility, long-term learning, continuous improvement, and ease of support and maintenance.

I've got heaps of experience working with leaders, product managers, designers, engineers, marketing professionals and support staff to develop a technical web strategy that balances these aims. And I'm an experienced leader myself, able to motivate and mentor teams to produce great work.

But what worked for me in the past may not work for your product. Unlike big consulting companies that provide similar, much more expensive services, I focus on helping your team learn what works for you, not on short-term quick fixes that make me look good.

Get in touch now and describe your current situation. I'll get back in touch as quickly as I can.

## What people I've worked with have to say...

> Jim was instrumental in building FanDuel into the cross-platform product it is today. He single handedly built our first mobile website, and brought product and UX insight as well as technical implementation. Later, he architected and led the creation of our API, which now underpins our product ecosystem. Beyond his technical contribution he built an excellent team and helped the organization with its agile development approach. Inspiring, highly capable, and a positive problem solver, James was a pleasure to work with.
