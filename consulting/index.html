  <h2>Growing a web product is hard</h2>
  <p>Is your team struggling to create real value for users because they're fighting against the UI code you already have?</p>
  <p>How do you know if you're using the right technical approach for short term value and long-term momentum?</p>
  <p>Do you worry that your competitors will outpace you and deliver that killer feature first?</p>
  <p>Do you wish your user interface was more compelling? Faster? Easier to use?</p>
  <p>Is your team so focused on keeping back-end and infrastructure systems running that the user interface is a second-class citizen?</p>
  <p>Are you able to execute the grand vision you have for your product?</p>

  <h2>Take advantage of modern web technologies</h2>
  <p>Web application user interfaces used to be thin layers of HTML and CSS on top of lots of server-side logic.</p>
  <p>These days, browsers are full application environments in their own right. The complexity of front-end software can now rival or exceed that of back-end systems.</p>
  <p>Does your product take advantage of modern browser capabilities?</p>
  <p>Does it cater for all users, irrespective of their abilities or the device they are using?</p>

  <h2>Enable your team to build amazing user interfaces</h2>
  <p>To deal with the complexity of modern web user interfaces, front-end engineers are adopting seasoned software engineering practices.
  Test and build automation, continuous integration and continuous deployment.</p>
  <p>And of course there are countless open source JavaScript application frameworks, libraries and tools out there to choose from. How do you know what is right for your product and your team?</p>
  <p>What if your team want to rewrite your whole user interface in a new framework? Is that the right thing to do?</p>
  <p>Does your team have the skills and tools they need to build and maintain a complex modern web application?</p>
  <p>Is your front-end code exposed to the same rigorous checks as your back-end code?</p>

  <h2>I've done this before</h2>
  <p>I was Lead Front-End Engineer and then a Director of Engineering at FanDuel for four years. FanDuel is one of Scotland's two celebrated 'unicorn' startups, valued at over USD$1 billion.</p>
  <p>In my time at FanDuel, I shaped the cross-platform and technical web strategy for a fantasy sports product that now boasts well over one million players. I hired a team of front-end specialists as the company grew from 20 to 400 employees.</p>
  <p>Before that, I have the benefit of 20 years of development experience working in product teams for startups, agencies and big organisations like Sky and Channel 4.</p>
  <p>I'm equally familiar with the challenges and needs of plucky new startups and unicorns alike. Maybe I can help your company on it's journey too?</p>
