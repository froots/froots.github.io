title:      Unit testing Backbone.js applications with Jasmine and Sinon
---

# Introduction

In the last few months, Jeremy Ashkenas' Backbone.js has received plenty of coverage, with a number of decent tutorials popping up all over the place.

This is understandable. JavaScript applications are becoming more complex, and are mirroring or even taking on responsibility for behaviour that was traditionally provided by the server tier, with the server providing a RESTful JSON API for reading and manipulating data over Ajax.

With all this key functionality being shifted or mirrored on the front-end, it is more important than ever to ensure that your JavaScript application has adequate test coverage.

In this article, I will show some approaches to unit testing Backbone.js applications using the Jasmine BDD test framework, and the Sinon.JS spying, stubbing and mocking library. If you are not familiar with these libraries, I would advise taking a few minutes to get to know what they are and how they work.

## Jasmine BDD

The Jasmine BDD test framework provides a behaviour-driven development approach to testing JavaScript applications.
