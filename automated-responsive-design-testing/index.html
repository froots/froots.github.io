    <h2>Automate!</h2>
    <p>With some upfront time investment, automating your cross-browser layout testing can <strong>pay off handsomely</strong> over the course of a project.</p>
    <p>There are now tools that can test your layouts in a wide range of browsers and devices for you.</p>
    <p>Automated testing tools can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be set up to run tests <strong>on demand</strong>, or <strong>automatically</strong> when code changes</li>
      <li><strong>test responsive designs</strong>, so that you can set different expectations at different screen dimensions</li>
      <li>run all these tests <strong>in the cloud</strong> so you don't need to run your own expensive device laboratory</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="row section">
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>By automating such a big chunk of work, you may see some of these benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save many, many hours over the course of your project</li>
      <li>Reduce the amount of time you spend maintaining test browsers and devices</li>
      <li>Colleagues, clients or managers will think you are a magician</li>
      <li>You and your team will be more motivated to fix bugs</li>
      <li>Your design process can change for the better, by embracing testing earlier</li>
      <li>Take an incremental approach to quality</li>
