  <p>Tinned Fruit Missives is a tiny-ish newsletter about front-end product engineering practices and principles.</p>

  <p>You won't see links about the latest hot JavaScript framework or nifty CSS animation techniques. Instead, I focus on front-end product engineering practices, growing teams, and long-term technical strategy. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
