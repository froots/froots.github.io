# One-to-One Front-End Lead Coaching

---

## Congratulations on your promotion!

Are you a new lead front-end developer? Do you suddenly find yourself responsible for front-end development strategy and approach for a whole product or company?

__Congratulations!__ You've got an incredible job that can be highly rewarding.

But, it's also daunting.

There are so many things going on. So much could be improved. And everyone has different opinions about what needs fixing first.

What's more, you're probably learning how to lead and manage other people for the first time.

How are you going to focus on making the right improvements while helping your team ship amazing product features?

## Help is here

Imagine having the confidence to make a huge impact in your role. To focus on the things that you know will make the biggest difference.

You can get there with guidance from someone who has been through all this before.

Benefit from my experience and expertise as a front-end product development leader with this bespoke one-to-one coaching programme.

## Coaching to help you succeed

Coaching is all about helping _you_ to do great work, not taking credit for the work myself.

Every front-end lead role is different, so we'll start out with a two-hour coaching call where we'll explore the big challenges that you're currently facing. What we talk about is completely up to you.

And if you're not happy with our first session for any reason whatsoever, ask and I'll happily reimburse your fee.

After the kickoff session, there are three levels available:

__Option 1: Monthly session__ - One two-hour coaching session per month. Each session is completely dedicated to your current situation.

__Option 2: Monthly session + on-demand coaching__ - In addition to a scheduled monthly coaching session, you can contact me via email or Slack at any time. I reply within 24 hours, but usually much quicker during business hours.

__Option 3: 2 monthly sessions + on-demand coaching__ - For those who really want to boost their impact, we'll meet twice a month instead of once. Plus anytime email / Slack access.

## The Details

All of our coaching sessions will be two hours long. I have found that you need two hours to explore topics with the depth they deserve.

You'll need to be able to commit your time to these regular sessions without interruptions or distractions.

After each session, I'll send an email summarising what we discussed, and any actions and commitments we agreed to.

In between sessions, you can also benefit from unlimited email or Slack-based coaching. I promise to respond to questions within 24 hours, but will usually reply much sooner.

## Pricing

__Option 1: Monthly session__ - £750 per month or £3,900 for six months

__Option 2: Monthly session + on-demand coaching__ - £1,100 per month or £5,900 for six months

__Option 3: 2 monthly sessions + on-demand-coaching__ - £1,450 per month or £7,800 for six months

## Kind words from my students

Cedric

Philip

## Yeah, but...

__You probably can't help. My circumstances are special.__

Yes, every person's situation is different, but in my experience most problems that crop up follow very similar patterns.

Coaching is not about me solving your problems for you. Instead, I use my experience and expertise in tech leadership to guide you towards your own answers. Even ones that I've never solved myself before.

I can't guarantee that you will solve every challenge with my help. But I can probably help you to think differently about them.

If you're in doubt, you can apply anyway describing your situation so we can explore if there is a good fit.

I won't take on any students who I'm not convinced that I can help.

And if you realise that coaching isn't for you in the first month, I'll happily reimburse the whole fee.

__I can't get my manager to pay for this__

Don't be afraid to admit to your manager that you would benefit from some help.

If you're new to tech leadership, it can be easy to become overwhelmed with your new responsibilities.

It's in your manager's interests to help you succeed. After all, they've promoted you or hired you because they recognise the need for leadership in front-end development.

Other people in your organisation - including your manager - might already be mentoring you and coaching you in some aspects of your role.

But you might not have access to someone who has direct experience of front-end leadership and all that entails.

Have a conversation with your manager, send them a link to this page, and ask them to contact me with any questions they have. I'd be more than happy to speak to them.

__What's so special about you that you can coach others?__

I'm not special, and that helps me to coach others.

I'm not a 100x developer or a polymath. I got into web development in the 1990s and learned it as I went along.

I'm good at listening. I've been in leadership roles for well over a decade in both agency and product development companies.

My most recent leadership role was as Director of Front End Engineering at FanDuel, where I grew the front-end capability from hastily-built MVP to a polished multi-channel entertainment experience with millions of users and hired a team of dedicated front-end developers along the way.

Unlike more generic leadership coaches, I can help with front-end and product development topics, as well as people management skills. You won't find a coach with more directly relevant experience.

I only coach front-end leaders, because that's what I know best.

## Your first month is risk-free

Coaching only works if both parties want to be there.

If you decide in the first 30 days that my coaching is not for your __for any reason__, I will happily reimburse your entire fee.

## How to apply

Apply for coaching by clicking the button below.

There's a short form to fill out, and then I'll get back to you as soon as I can to get the ball rolling.

To give everyone enough attention, I have a maximum of five one-to-one coaching students. Don't miss out!
