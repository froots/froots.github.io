## FAQs

### What makes you think you can help me?

I have over 20 years of web development experience for SaaS startups, consumer giants and government departments.

As the Director of Front-End Engineering at FanDuel, I helped grow the company to a valuation of over USD$1 billion and shaped technical web strategy to transform the product from MVP into a slick multi-channel experience over a four-year period.

I'm familiar with the challenges experienced by growing SaaS companies. I can help your company as you tread this path.
