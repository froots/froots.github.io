## FAQs

### What makes you think you can help me?

I have over 20 years of web development experience for SaaS startups, consumer giants and government departments.

As the Director of Front-End Engineering at FanDuel, I helped grow the company to a valuation of over USD$1 billion and shaped technical web strategy to transform the product from MVP into a slick multi-channel experience over a four-year period.

I'm familiar with the challenges experienced by growing SaaS companies. I can help your company as you tread this path.

### What will I get?

* A 60-minute video call on appear.in or Skype
* A recording of the call
* An email summary of the key points discussed
* One week follow-up email

### What can we really achieve in one hour?

We'll need to stay focused to get everything done in an hour. Here's what we'll do:

1. Introductions and setup (5 mins)
2. Overview of your product (5 mins)
3. Current front-end challenges (20 mins)
4. Review and prioritise challenges (10 mins)
5. Discuss possible actions (15 mins)
6. Finish up (5 mins)

### Do I need to give you access to our codebase?

No, though you'll need to be able to speak freely and honestly about your product and app. We can sign a mutual non-disclosure agreement if you like.

### Do I need to prepare anything?

You'll want to think about and make a note of the challenges you have, and what you've done about them so far.

## My guarantee

If you feel like our call wasn't time well spent, __I'll happily reimburse 100% of the fee__.

Unlike web development agencies or big strategy consultants, you'll talk to me alone, and I'll focus on what's best for your company in the long-term, not on short-term Band-Aids.
