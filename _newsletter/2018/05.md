I've managed to choose a curiously web-free set of primary links this month. It's easy to focus on web stuff at the exclusion of other things, but there's much to be learned from elsewhere, of course. Not least because us front-end developers are often teased for discovering and re-invigorating long-dead software design patterns from the 1980s. And we don't like to be teased.

Have an enjoyable and productive month!

### [Delivering on Something That Doesn't Exist](https://medium.com/@trcull/delivering-on-something-that-doesnt-exist-bfa2e84edbec) - Tim Cull

If you've ever worked in a sales-driven B2B SaaS or product company, this article may feel all too familiar. Tim Cull questions pervasive incentive culture that permits sales staff to be rewarded for closing deals based on software features that don't yet exist. It's not as ranty as you might expect, though. He presents a fair-minded assessment of where this problem comes from and how you can alleviate it before it causes real damage.

### [Software Testing Anti-patterns](http://blog.codepipes.com/testing/software-testing-antipatterns.html) - Kostis Kapelonis

Opinionated list of common testing anti-patterns. I don't 100% agree with all of these, but there is some well-earned pragmatic advice here. I particularly like the horses-for-courses test pyramids that depend on the type of product that you're testing.

### [A Taxonomy of Tech Debt](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/taxonomy-tech-debt) - Bill Clark

Tech debt is fun! Or at least, reading about _other people's_ tech debt is fun. Here, Bill Clark looks at how you can categorise and prioritise tech debt along three metrics, and uses examples from Riot Games' _League of Legends_ to illustrate. I'm intrigued by the concept of _contagion_ as a measure of how much worse the problem is likely to get.
