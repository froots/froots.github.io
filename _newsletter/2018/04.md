### [Are you out of alignment?](https://medium.com/@skamille/are-you-out-of-alignment-a7b193ab7fc4) - Camille Fournier

Not a CSS post, but a vitally important read for anyone who ever spends more than 10 seconds thinking about what would be the best thing for them and the team to be working on at any given time. That's you, right?

### [Using Ethics in Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/using-ethics-in-web-design/) - Morten Rand-Hendriksen
