As a former social scientist, I'm naturally sceptical about surveys, at least until I see a nice visualisation, and then I completely believe everything I see. Brains are funny, aren't they?

The _State of JavaScript_ survey gets some good coverage among developers each year, but I still worry that there are inherent biases. Nevertheless, there are nice charts to look at. Curiously, the theme of this year's results seems to be... _stability_. React is still popular. How underwhelming.

But as always it's the questions that are left out of the survey altogether that are the most revealing. That's an exercise left up to the reader.

Have a great month!

The annual JavaScript developer survey is back. Caveats about surveys and sampling bias aside, this is always useful for keeping a high-level eye on developer attitudes. That gender distribution, though... :-(


### [A Netflix Web Performance Case Study](https://medium.com/dev-channel/a-netflix-web-performance-case-study-c0bcde26a9d9) - Addy Osmani

Addy's back again with a lesson for all web product teams. Landing pages and apps have two very different purposes and need different - but coordinated - front end strategies. The technical info here is useful, but it's also a healthy reminder that even the big tech companies can make performance blunders if it's not being measured or observed.

### [Refactoring an inherited codebase](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/refactoring-an-inherited-codebase) - Chen Hui Jing

And at the other end of the team size scale, here's a case study of a front end 'refactoring' (rewrite) carried out by one person. I enjoyed the approach here, and the performance gains, but I do wonder about the ongoing maintainability of the rewrite for others in the team...
