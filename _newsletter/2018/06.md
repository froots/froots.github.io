I just found out that Microsoft have bought GitHub, so this newsletter may be fired into a completely distracted audience.

Remember folks, a server-rendered, Rails-based app with only a little JavaScript sprinkling can be worth $7.5b.

Have a great month!

### [A Simple Introduction to Intrinsic Web Design](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2018/05/a-simple-introduction-to-intrinsic-web-design/) - Ezequiel Bruni

You're going to hear the term _intrinsic web design_ a lot in the future I think. We are rapidly approaching the time when we can actually design for the web in a way that the platform intrinsically supports. As someone who's been doing this for 20 years, all I can say is _YES!! FINALLY!_

### [Making Legacy Sites More Performant with Modern Front-End Techniques](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/making-legacy-sites-more-performant-using-modern-frontend-techniques) - Mike Herchel

A great starting point for anyone who wants to tackle that 80-90% of end-user response time that's spent on front-end concerns. Up to date for 2018's tech, so includes HTTP/2, visual regression testing, resource pre-loading and other potential big wins.

### [Mary Meeker's Internet Trends 2018](http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends)

The annual super-deck detailing the state of the commercial internet is back. Can't believe it's been a year. I haven't finished reading the 2017 version yet!
