The topic of developer experience vs user experience comes up in the front end world about as often as the topic of CSS-in-JS, usually with the same amount of vehement commentary. On that note, this month's _Missives_ includes some contrasting debate of the topic. Alex Russell gets justifiably angry, and Jason Lengstorf tries to temper the rage with some pragmatic advice that looks a lot like user-centered design. Meanwhile, GitHub got on with some actual work on their front end.

Have a great month!

### [The “Developer Experience” Bait-and-Switch](https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/) - Alex Russell

The culture of developer enablement and happiness needs to be reset, according to Alex Russell. JavaScript is the web's carbon dioxide - we use too much of it and those who emit the most are furthest from the consequences. Is it time to take some more radical steps to stop this trend?

### [Breaking the Deadlock Between User Experience and Developer Experience](https://alistapart.com/article/breaking-the-deadlock-between-user-experience-and-developer-experience) - Jason Lengstorf

Jason presents some actionable advice for breaking the apparent incompatibility between developer and user experience. The tl;dr of this article for me is: align your team to user outcomes, do more user research and understand the ongoing cost of providing a valuable product. In the absence of this, a team will naturally gravitate to improving the developer experience, because that's an audience they _do_ understand well.

### [Removing jQuery from GitHub.com frontend](https://githubengineering.com/removing-jquery-from-github-frontend/) - Various GitHubbers

A great case study of a long-term, part-time front-end migration effort. No developer experience bait-and-switch here. The team made clever use of linting and other automation to keep momentum going where so many of these efforts fizzle out and die.
