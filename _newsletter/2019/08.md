After a brief hiatus last month (I accidentally went on holiday), I'm back with links. I don't think I missed very much except for some mud-slinging about the worthiness of _micro-frontends_, which I am pretending I didn't see and so never happened.

### [I Used The Web For A Day On A 50 MB Budget](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/web-on-50mb-budget/) - Chris Ashton

Another excellent - if not exactly scientific - experiment by Chris Ashton. This should be suitable eye-opening if your product is intended for a global audience.

### [The cost of JavaScript in 2019](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019) - Addy Osmani

And if you really want to get deep on performance optimisation, especially on mobile, Addy is back again to help out. 

### [Internet Explorer 3, an adventure in cross-browser compatibility](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/internet-explorer-3-an-adventure-in-compatibility/) - Chen Hui Jing

In which I chuckle at a youngster rediscovering terrible hacks to get stuff working in a 1990's web browser. Charming but (mostly) useless.
