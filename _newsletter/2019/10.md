This month, I've chosen three articles that quite neatly explain my attitude towards how front end tech should be managed in product development teams. In short: hire people for learning mindset, encourage product and user-centric thinking and empower your teams to succeed by keeping the technology choices simple. Sounds, er, simple, doesn't it? üò¨

Have a great month!

### [The Product-Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) - Gergely Orosz

This post highlights the characteristics and capabilities of a product-focused developer mindset that I'm trying to foster in my own work with developers and product engineering leaders. A successful career in product development depends on so much more than technical capabilities and experience.

### [21st Century Recruiting](https://aleph.vc/21st-century-recruiting-c08f25c2fe04) - Avishai Ish-Shalom

I don't post much about hiring and recruitment here, but it's a huge part of building an effective product team. Most product organisations seem to hire for specific technical skills, but Avishai argues instead that we should "hire people with the ability and motivation to learn and adapt, and then build an organization with the right culture to support them."

### [Make it Boring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OikwaVcdHG4) (Video) - Jeremy Wagner

And once you've hired people with a learning mindset, how can product teams continue to succeed? Keep the tech choices simple so that serving users and customers can continue to be your primary focus. Jeremy Wagner explains how.
