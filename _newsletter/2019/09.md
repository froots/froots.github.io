For those of you who don't know me, I've been very much out of the world of web development in the last year, so I've been able to take a slightly more, well, detached interest. I am not currently working on a product or in a product team, but I do speak to a lot of people who are. We almost never talk about front-end tech in isolation. Even technical conversations quickly turn to the social or societal context in which they're embedded. Hot dramas in tech (such as last month's #ReactGate) reveal much about our sense of identity and group attachment. It's fascinating that these emotional and social factors are so strongly attached to something as seemingly rational and concrete as a code library. It's almost as if there's more to it than writing code...

Have a great month!

### [React - Why I have a problem with React the library and spend a lot of time talking to my therapist](https://sonniesedge.co.uk/posts/react) - Charlie Owen

Many called this controversial, but I don't see much to object to here. If you don't believe a code library can have such a big impact on group dynamics at scale you haven't been paying enough attention.

### [The truth about the ROI of Web Accessibility](https://karlgroves.com/2019/08/27/the-truth-about-the-roi-of-web-accessibility) - Karl Groves

There are plenty of articles about making the return-on-investment (ROI) case for web accessibility, but this post takes it a little further. For example, your best results are likely to come from deliberately using accessibility as a market differentiator.

### [Product vs. Feature Teams](https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/) - Marty Cagan

Of increasing relevance in my mostly non-front-end-development work of late, Marty describes the difference between _feature teams_ and _empowered product teams_. This should be useful to you if you feel that your team(s) doesn't have the right inputs and incentives to do their best work.
