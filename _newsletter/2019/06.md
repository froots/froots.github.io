### [A Conspiracy To Kill IE6](https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6) - Chris Zacharias

I'm torn by this historical admission of rogueish unilateral decision making at YouTube. On the one hand, I've done similar things to this myself under the banner of 'ask for forgiveness not permission'. But it's also an example of developers putting themselves before users.

### [Improving third-party web performance at The Telegraph](https://medium.com/the-telegraph-engineering/improving-third-party-web-performance-at-the-telegraph-a0a1000be5) - Gareth Clubb

A performance improvement case study demonstrating the importance of focusing on long-term operational and team practices as well as the technical details.

### [How !important are we?](https://medium.com/@codepo8/how-important-are-we-2fdd08afe3c0) - Christian Heilmann

I'm not quite sure what Christian's point is here, but you can happily add this to the pile marked 'checked your ego at the door'.
