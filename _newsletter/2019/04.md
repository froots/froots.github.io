Recently on a tech-centric Slack group I belong to, someone asked "How do you describe your job to a non-techie person?" For some reason, like a sudden bolt from the blue, I responded with "I help other people to write less software."

I was joking, but when I looked at what I'd written I realised that I had just come up with a killer elevator pitch. This month's lead articles are very much on brand with this sentiment. I'll leave it up to you to see the connections.

Have a great month!
