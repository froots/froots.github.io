My recent work has focused not so much on front-end stuff, but on early-stage product development, innovation and entrepreneurship. This is great fun, but it's been enjoyable to get my head down and read through my front-end product development reading backlog too.

January's existential crisis seems to have (mostly) abated and we have some more positive, forward-thinking articles from February. Except of course for the group of unabashed sentimentalists who have created a [simulation of Tim Berners-Lee's original WorldWideWeb browser](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/). Pure frivolity.

Have a great month!

### [Make it Boring](https://jeremy.codes/blog/make-it-boring/) - Jeremy Wagner

Following on from the February edition existential crisis, here's a wonderfully reasoned call to drop the creator's urge to make life exciting for ourselves and focus instead on the joys of deliberate utilitarianism (or is it functionalism?).

### [Lessons from 6 software rewrite stories](https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22) - Herb Caudill

The Spolskyean advice to avoid rewriting your software product at all costs only applies if you're not planning on making big changes to what the product actually offers. This article demonstrates that 'Should we rewrite or iterate?' is probably not quite the right question.

### [How to Build Product-Oriented Engineering Teams](https://amplitude.com/blog/how-to-build-product-oriented-engineering-teams) - Ryan Ashcraft

A useful primer on why and how to start making the change from working as a output-driven feature factory to an outcome-focused cross-functional product team.
