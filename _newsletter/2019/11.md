### [U.S. Supreme Court Passes on Domino’s Case: Commenters Misunderstand](https://www.lflegal.com/2019/10/dominos-comments/) - Lainey Feingold

This post clears about a few things about the implications of the US Supreme Court ruling on the case against Domino's pizza for failing to provide an accessible web-based ordering service. An enjoyable read, not least because it reveals much about how people still think about disabled rights.

### [A Business Case for Dropping Internet Explorer](https://css-tricks.com/a-business-case-for-dropping-internet-explorer/) - Ollie Williams

I don't agree with everything that I post in this newsletter, and this article is a good example. Like it or not, making a decision to drop support for a browser is much more than a business decision in most cases.

### [The “P” in Progressive Enhancement stands for “Pragmatism”](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/the-p-in-progressive-enhancement-stands-for-pragmatism/) - Andy Bell

Counterpoint to the above. If you consider a broad definition of support to go beyond 'identical in every browser', there is no need to slam the door in the face of someone using a browser for which they currently have no realistic alternative.
