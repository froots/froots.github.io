### [The Cost of JavaScript](https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-cost-of-javascript-84009f51e99e) - _Addy Osmani_

https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-cost-of-javascript-84009f51e99e

If you're developing web applications for consumer mobile devices (which I suspect is most people reading this newsletter in some capacity), then Addy lays down some extremely valuable, research-heavy JavaScript performance optimisation nuggets. Please please please test your web applications on representative 'average' devices and not just on your shiny iPhone X. There is an order of magnitude difference in performance.

### [Declining Complexity in CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2017/11/14/declining-complexity-in-css/) - _Eric Meyer_

http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2017/11/14/declining-complexity-in-css/

CSS has grown rapidly in its capabilities over the last few years, but not necessarily in its complexity, or how difficult it is to use. There's a thread of a common architectural principal here: a language with a broad set of capabilities does not have to result in complex implementations. The JavaScript community had a similar awakening with the publication of _JavaScript: The Good Parts_ nearly a decade ago now.

### [Using CSS Grid: Supporting Browsers Without Grid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/11/css-grid-supporting-browsers-without-grid/) - _Rachel Andrew_

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/11/css-grid-supporting-browsers-without-grid/

This should be your new go-to article when someone asks whether CSS Grid is ready for production. As always, the answer is 'it depends', but Rachel's article describes how you actually decide whether your project is ready for it and what supporting it actually involves.

## Some other World Wide Web hyperlinks I have enjoyed this month

* [Introducing the New Firefox: Firefox Quantum](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) - _Mark Mayo_ - I switched to Firefox from Chrome as a trial and so far I'm seeing very little reason to switch back again.

* [WebAssembly support now shipping in all major browsers](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/) - _Judy DeMocker_ - We might start seeing some more mainstream WebAssembly stuff pretty soon. Time to brush off my C++ skills (exactly four lectures at university).
