Sorry, subscribers. There won't be any articles about designing and optimizing your web apps for the iPhone X this month. It saddens me a bit to see the popularity of articles about dealing with a screen notch on an unreleased device - particularly when so many sites continue to do a bad job of basic accessibility and design for devices used by millions that have been around for years.

Instead, we've got some cracking links focusing on the long-term challenges of building high-quality web products, with a focus on infrastructure, team skills, performance and technology choice.

All the best,

### [How to Run a Front-End Infrastructure Team](http://tech.adroll.com/blog/frontend/2017/08/29/how-to-run-a-front-end-infrastructure-team.html) - Jyri Tuulos

http://tech.adroll.com/blog/frontend/2017/08/29/how-to-run-a-front-end-infrastructure-team.html

It's refreshing to see an in-depth post about what it takes to run a modern front-end web application with contributions from multiple teams. The concept of a central front-end team is becoming more prevalent, as organisations realise that 'platform' no longer means just server-side architecture and operations.

### [Is there any value in people who cannot write JavaScript?](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06) - Mandy Michael

https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06

This article stirred up some social media discussion around the value of non-JavaScript front-end skills. You didn't ask for it, but I will add my own unequivocal opinion: if you doubt the value of CSS and HTML skills, and associated skills like accessibility, your business will eventually suffer.

### [A React And Preact Progressive Web App Performance Case Study: Treebo](https://medium.com/dev-channel/treebo-a-react-and-preact-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-5e4f450d5299) - Lakshya Ranganath & Addy Osmani

https://medium.com/dev-channel/treebo-a-react-and-preact-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-5e4f450d5299

A very detailed dive into performance improvements for a progressive web app, representing many hours of work. For me, this article neatly demonstrates how the increased capabilities of the web platform have made performance improvements increasingly complex.

### [How to prevent big front-end rewrites with lean technology choices](https://medium.com/cto-craft/how-to-prevent-big-front-end-rewrites-with-lean-technology-choices-103841b5f024) - Jim Newbery

https://medium.com/cto-craft/how-to-prevent-big-front-end-rewrites-with-lean-technology-choices-103841b5f024

I wrote for CTO Craft on making more sustainable technology and architecture choices for your front-end by embracing lean engineering principles. I believe it's better to focus on learning, just-in-time decisions and team empowerment rather than imposing an 'objective' criterion-scoring process.
